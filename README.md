 # 🎬 Pixar SQL Data Analysis Project

Welcome to my SQL-based data analysis project on **Pixar Animation Studios**! This project explores what makes a Pixar movie a hit—looking at box office performance, critical acclaim, and director impact using structured queries and insightful visualizations.

## 📌 Project Overview

Pixar has created some of the most iconic animated films in cinematic history. But which ones truly stand out in terms of financial success, critical ratings, and awards? This project uses **MySQL** to answer key questions by analyzing a curated dataset of Pixar films.

## 🔍 Key Questions Explored

- Which Pixar films generated the highest net profit? Are the most profitable films also the highest budgeted?
- Which films received the most awards and highest IMDb ratings?
- Which directors consistently delivered critically acclaimed movies?
- How has Pixar’s worldwide box office performance trended over the years?
- How do Pixar films classify into *Blockbuster*, *Commercial Success*, or *Underperformer*?

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Database:** MySQL (Relational Database)
- **Tools Used:** SQL Views, Grouping, Joins, Aggregates, CASE statements
- **Visualization:** PowerPoint (for data storytelling)

## 🧠 Insights & Outcomes

- *Inside Out 2* had both the highest budget and net profit.
- *Up* and *Toy Story 3* are among the most awarded and best-rated films.
- Director **Brad Bird**, with only 3 films, ranked as the most acclaimed.
- A classification model was built to evaluate film success based on net profit and IMDb ratings.

### 🎯 Classification Criteria:

- **Blockbuster**: Net profit > 2× Budget AND above-average IMDb rating  
- **Commercial Success**: Net profit ≥ Budget AND average or above rating  
- **Underperformer**: Net profit < Budget OR below-average rating
